# Stopwatch Project Documentation

## Project Title

**Digital Stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

---

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple digital stopwatch that can **start**, **stop**, and **reset** time using basic web technologies.

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – to create the structure of the stopwatch
* **CSS** – to style the stopwatch interface
* **JavaScript** – to implement the stopwatch logic and time calculation

---

## Features

* Displays time in **HH:MM:SS** format
* Start button to begin counting time
* Stop button to pause the stopwatch
* Reset button to clear the time
* Prevents multiple timers from running at the same time

---

## Working Principle

* JavaScript uses `setInterval()` to update time every second
* Seconds increase first; when they reach 60, minutes increase
* When minutes reach 60, hours increase
* The updated time is displayed dynamically on the screen

---

## Use Case

This project is useful for:

* Beginners learning JavaScript timing functions
* Practicing DOM manipulation
* Mini-projects for college or school
* Understanding event handling in web development

---

## Conclusion

The stopwatch project demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build an interactive web application. It is simple, efficient, and easy to extend with features like milliseconds or lap tracking.
